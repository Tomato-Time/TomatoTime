## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Starting to get the hang of material ui. This week we were successful at learning because we read a lot of material ui documentation. We completely finished the wireframes and they look better than our initial product Nick says it looks professional. The backend is coming along well. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Material ui was a challenge. Susan: time management because I wish I would've gotten more done this week. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 we didn't finish everything on our sprint this week but it was moslty due to the material ui learning curve. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Jeff's videos were helpful for setting up the backend for our web app. In regards to the front end we relied on material ui docs. However, the instructional team was very helpful in answering the questions that came up while we were working. The planning that went into git hub was helpful to remain organized (issues, user stories, project board)

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 We heard that a calendar might be difficult to implement but we have not looked into it. Possible light mode becuase we have not planned it out. The light mode will be ommited and we could display the user's stats in a different format.

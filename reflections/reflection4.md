## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 The bug bash was really helpful for our group to identify things that we needed to improve. We did a great job at making our way through that list. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 I had a lot of trouble with the checkbox component and the solution ended up being very simple. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we did finish all of our tasks 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The resources were helpful. However, a lot of the issues we stumbled upon had to do with css and material ui. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Flow time was a feature that was at risk and we decided it would be best to not implement it and focus on improving upon what we have

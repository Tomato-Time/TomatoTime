## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

This week we manged to get our MVP done. Our MVP consists of a working timer that uses the Pomodoro Method (25 min focus/5 min break time). The user is able to restart and skip the timer, we also indicate the user what stage of their Pomodoro cycle they're in. The Log in and  Registration pages are compleate. We are surrently working on improving our side bar, nav bar, and our draggable popups.  

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some challenges inncluded the buttons for the timer and adding the break mode feature. Learning how to use material UI also took time specially with customizing compoenents. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished most of our tasks and we were able to finish some we didn't plan on finsihing this week. This was able to balance the project feature timeleine we had set. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 We relied a lot on documentation specially for Material UI. We also recieved a lot of help from our CodePath instructors and Worday mentors.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 The statistics popup that has a calendar feature that we're not sure how to implement that in relation to the data we'll gather.

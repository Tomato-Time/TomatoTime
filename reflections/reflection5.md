## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 
* The capstone period was a good amount of time but the first 4 weeks of the internship were filled with information. Perhaps if we had more time to feel comfortable with the technologies we learned it would have gone smoother. 

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?
We had a good idea and we did a good job of sticking to what we had set out to do. Most of our hiccups came from issues with learning material ui. What we would do differently if we got another chance to start over would be to better identify what features we wanted and what tech we would have to learn in order to make it happen. 

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?
The backend labs were really helpful and Jeff did a great job at explaining what was going on and important concepts. The assignments were very rushed. It was difficult to work on both the lab and the assignment. It made it so that students prioritized the assignment over the labs and because of that the labs were sometimes left unfinished. 

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)
* Jeff's videos were very helpful. Everything else mentioned was also very helpful to us. The mentors and instructors were very knowledgeable and it was great to have access to their input during the entire process.

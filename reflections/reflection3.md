## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We improved upon our mvp now that we are further along our core features we can improve upon what we have and it starting to look more like a site that would be useful to many. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 The styling for the login and registration form gave us some issues and a lot of time had already been put into it 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We did accomplish a lot but we did not do as much as we could have because our time was spent working on previous assignments. However, it was important and our team can't wait to get back to the capstone 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 I continue to rely on the backend skills we have learned from jeff to do anything. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

our calendar is no longer at risk and coming along nicely. However, sharing the link to a pomodoro, dark mode, and showing the timer in the url title bar are all stretch features that are potentially at risk just due to time.

# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Nicholas de Souza, Yuvia Leon, Susan Guerrero**

## Problem Statement

Students usually have trouble focusing on their tasks and forming effective study habits.

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?
 creating a Pomodoro website that keeps them engaged with leaderboards (like a video game), keeping their to-do list in the same place, and various features can help keep them focused on what to do. As students ourselves we feel that our website is mainly for the student population but our site would benefit anyone trying to be more efficient with their work or study habits. 


## Expected Features List

Add a list of your groups's brainstormed features list

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?

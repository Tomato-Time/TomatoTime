# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Nicholas de Souza, Yuvia Leon, Susan Guerrero**

## Problem Statement

As students, we know how difficult it can be to find effective study techniques that could carry through as habits. With constant distractions, students can find themselves drifting away from their tasks or study excessively for long periods of time. Both can be ineffective and contribute to unhealthy study habits which, can affect one's mental health. Our target audiences are students and individuals who work in an office-like setting who hope to improve their productivity, manage their distractions, maintain motivation, and decrease their mental fatigue.

## Description

Our audience will use our website to implement the Pomodoro method by using our timer and web features which can be customized to their specific needs while promoting a serene work environment. They can add/remove tasks to their to-do list and track their progress by the day, week, month, and year by accessing their personal account.


## Expected Features List

- Core
    - A large timer counts down (the timer can be paused & played)
    - Login feature
    - Landing page with the ability to interact with buttons that take you to a different page
    - To do list that allows the user to add and remove tasks
    - Tracks when a user completed a full Pomodoro (month/day/year) by associating activity to their account
    - Allow the user to customize the intervals of work/break in a "settings" tab
- Stretch (not in any particular order)
    - Timer displays on URL title
    - About page with information about the Pomodoro method
    - Information that is meant to serve as positive affirmations or motivators for the user. A feature that the user can opt in or out of. Managed in settings tab.
    - Dark mode
    - Ability to share link so that multiple people can work off of the same clock
    - Ability to label a task and then keep track of how long was spent working on that labeled task
    - Only a large timer displays when the page is minimized to a small size

## Related Work

Similar apps and websites are Pomodor, Marinara Timer, Forest, and Be Focused Pro. These apps and websites all have aspects that we enjoy; we can take the best features from each of the websites/similar websites and implement them in our own project to improve both the focus and productivity of the user. Implementation of a to-do list and other features similar to a GitHub-like tracking system can encourage students to continue using our website.  Our focus is to create one Pomodoro website that has the most important aspects from other websites to maximize productivity and it will be also customizable, so that the user can utilize what they want.

## Open Questions

We need to research how to implement some of the features we've mentioned above (this can be supplemented with tutorials online)

# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Nicholas de Souza, Yuvia Leon, Susan Guerrero**

## Problem Statement

Students usually have trouble focusing on their tasks and forming effective study habits.

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?
 creating a Pomodoro website that keeps them engaged with leaderboards (like a video game), keeping their to-do list in the same place, and various features can help keep them focused on what to do. As students ourselves we feel that our website is mainly for the student population but our site would benefit anyone trying to be more efficient with their work or study habits. 


## Expected Features List

- Core
    - A large timer counts down (the timer can be paused & played)
    - Login feature
    - Landing page with the ability to interact with buttons that take you to a different page
    - To do list that allows the user to add and remove tasks
    - Tracks when a user completed a full Pomodoro (month/day/year) by associating activity to their account
    - Allow the user to customize the intervals of work/break in a "settings" tab
- Stretch (not in any particular order)
    - Timer displays on URL title
    - About page with information about the Pomodoro method
    - Information that is meant to serve as positive affirmations or motivators for the user. A feature that the user can opt in or out of. Managed in settings tab.
    - Dark mode
    - Ability to share link so that multiple people can work off of the same clock
    - Ability to label a task and then keep track of how long was spent working on that labeled task
    - Only a large timer displays when the page is minimized to a small size

## Related Work

Similar apps and websites are Pomodor, Marinara Timer, Forest, and Be Focused Pro. These apps and websites all have aspects that we enjoy; we can take the best features from each of the websites/similar websites and implement them in our own project to improve both the focus and productivity of the user. Implementation of a to-do list and other features similar to a GitHub-like tracking system can encourage students to continue using our website.  Our focus is to create one Pomodoro website that has the most important aspects from other websites to maximize productivity and it will be also customizable, so that the user can utilize what they want.

Pod Members: **Nicholas de Souza, Yuvia Leon, Susan Guerrero**

## Problem Statement

As students, we know how difficult it can be to find effective study techniques that could carry through as habits. With constant distractions, students can find themselves drifting away from their tasks or study excessively for long periods of time. Both can be ineffective and contribute to unhealthy study habits which, can affect one's mental health. Our target audiences are students and individuals who work in an office-like setting who hope to improve their productivity, manage their distractions, maintain motivation, and decrease their mental fatigue.

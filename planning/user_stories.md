## Problem Statement

As students, we know how difficult it can be to find effective study techniques that could carry through as habits. With constant distractions, students can find themselves drifting away from their tasks or study excessively for long periods of time. Both can be ineffective and contribute to unhealthy study habits which, can affect one's mental health. Our target audiences are students and individuals who work in an office-like setting who hope to improve their productivity, manage their distractions, maintain motivation, and decrease their mental fatigue.

## User Roles

-**Student:** a user who is seeking to improve their productivity and study habits.

-**Office Worker:** a user who is seeking to maintain motivation and decrease their mental fatigue.

## User Personas

-**Student:** 
  - Daniela is a 20 year old college student from New York studying computer science. Deadlines for assignments are coming up and midterm season is right around the corner. She's always been bad at managing her time, but now she wants to change that around.
  - Daniel is a 25 year old living in Los Angeles. He never finished high-school and so he's had to work odd jobs around the city. Recently, he's been going to his local library to study for his GED but he feels that it is very daunting with all the work he has to catch up on. 
  
-**Office Worker:** 
  - John is a 25 year old working at an investment banking firm in London. He's had to juggle multiple projects and is starting to feel stressed during his work hours. He wants to be more efficient with the time he spends on these projects so he can hopefully cut a couple of working hours from his day off.
  - Jane is a 43 year old living in NYC, working at an office. She spends most of her time sitting down and that's led to back problems. She's always prioritized working long hours but her doctor has recommended for her to take breaks a lot more frequently throughout the day.
